# Plan - Overview

## Overview

The Plan plug-in provides for integration with a Plan server. This plug-in imports Plan issues and saves them as DevOps Velocity issues. Data between the Plan server and the DevOps Velocity server is synchronized every five minutes.

## Compatibility

Must be running DevOps Velocity version 2.0.0 and later to use the plug-in.

## Upgrade notes

Beginning with DevOps Velocity version 2.4.0 users must enter a user access key is required to connect with the DevOps Velocity server. If you are upgrading from a previous version, you must obtain and add the key to the DevOps Velocity configuration property. If the user access key is not added, the integration fails.

## Versions

DevOps Velocity plug-in images are located in DockerHub. To view available versions, see the [UrbanCode DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/urbancode/ucv-ext-compass/tags).
