# GitHub - Overview

The GitHub plug-in provides for integration with a GitHub server. This plug-in imports issues, pull request and commit data from a GitHub server and saves them as DevOps Velocity issues. Data between the GitHub server and the DevOps Velocity server is synchronized every five minutes.

## Compatibility

Must be running DevOps Velocity version 1.2.1 and later to use the plug-in.

**Note:** For integrations created before upgrading to version 2.4.0 of DevOps Velocity, Auto-generated User Access Key is not present, so the integration will fail after upgrading. In this case, you have to manually add a new User Access Key in the hidden property named ***DevOps Velocity User Access Key.***

##  Upgrade impact

When migrating to version 1.0.30 of this plug-in, you must make an update to your integration. The **Name** property has been removed. Use the Repositories property to identify one or more GitHub repositories to be used to import data. Additionally, you must specify a value for the **DevOps Velocity User Access Key** property.

## Versions

DevOps Velocity plug-in images are located in DockerHub. To view available versions, see the [UrbanCode DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/urbancode/ucv-ext-github/tags).

## History

### Version 1.4.16

* **Enhancement**: This enhancement modifies the plugins synchronization behavior following a failure. Previously, the plugin would resume syncing from the date of the last successful synchronization. Now, it has been updated to continue syncing commits, pull-requests, and issues from the point where it last synced before the failure. This change ensures more accurate and efficient data synchronization by reducing the likelihood of missing or duplicating data in cases where the plugin had partially synced before encountering an issue.
